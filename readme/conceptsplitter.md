# conceptsplitter

conceptsplitter is a project designed to extract atomic concepts from a given text. It utilizes the OpenAI API to analyze and split the text into distinct core concepts, ensuring that each concept is clearly defined and elaborated upon. The project is particularly useful for extracting and organizing information from large text dumps, such as those from websites.

## Features

- Extract atomic concepts from a given text.
- Utilizes OpenAI API for sophisticated parsing.
- Saves extracted concepts as individual text files.
- Provides a clear structure for analyzing and splitting text based on specific guidelines.

## Directory Structure

```bash
.
├── .gitignore           # Git ignore file
├── _.env                # Environment variables (contains OpenAI API key)
├── concept_split.ppt    # Guidelines and example for text analysis
├── interface.py         # Interface to OpenAI API and core functions
├── requirements.txt     # Project dependencies
└── split_concepts.py    # Main script to process and save extracted concepts
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd conceptsplitter
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Obtain your OpenAI API key from the OpenAI platform.
   - Open the `_.env` file and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.
   - rename the file to `.env` (remove the underscore).

## Usage

1. Place the text files you want to process in the `~/Downloads` directory. Ensure that the filenames start with the prefix `text-`.

2. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python split_concepts.py
   ```

3. Extracted concepts will be saved as individual text files in the `~/desktop/atomic_notes` directory.
